User experience - Sindhura and Camila 

Testing – Angus

Communication – Aidan

Architecture – Michael

The '80s game we remade is Pole Position. The twist is that we added multiplayer functionality to the game. Many different players can all connect to the same lobby and race against each other to see who has the fastest lap.

## Architecture:

## User Experience 
The experience for a first-time user is intuitive. When the game is first launched, there are buttons on the main menu screen to create a game, join a game with a room code, and to quit. Once a game is made, the host is sent to a lobby screen in which they can wait for other players to join, or race by themselves. In the lobby screen, all players that have connected are displayed with a start game button on the bottom right that is available to the lobby host. The lobby host is signified with a crown over their car and is the person that started the game. Once the game has started, there is a countdown and the players are off, racing along the track until someone reaches the finish line. Once a player has reached the finish line, the game ends, and a snapshot of the leaderboard is displayed. A first-time user should launch the game and easily be able to race against friends or practice the mechanics of the game.

Players will know what to do because the design is intuitive and is very similar to many popular multiplayer games such as Among Us. Even players who are not avid gamers will know to hit a create game and start game button. Racing games as a genre are also very user-friendly with intuitive mechanics. 

The gameplay feels predictable for an experienced player. Since we have only one map right now, players can get familiar with the positioning of the turns and straightaways. This, combined with our more realistic physics compared to the original game will reward players who are familiar with the course. Effective braking on turns will be necessary to get faster times. 

The main draw that will make players want to keep coming back is the fastest lap time feature. This is the game’s version of a high score and players will want to beat their previous record. There are also slightly punishing game mechanics such as crashing when going too far off the track. This can result from not braking before turns and will ruin lap times. This is an added layer of difficulty that should keep players coming back to the game. There’s also the competitive aspect that comes with racing against friends. Competition between players within the lobby should create tension and make the game more fun. 

## Retrospective:
The process of writing this app was challenging. Coordinating to complete a project even in a small team of 5 was difficult. For a lot of us, this was the largest project we have worked on and it was also complicated. There were many unexpected issues that arose and making this simple game turned out to be quite the challenge. 

Communication was also a challenge for a long time. In the beginning we didn’t have a clear vision of what we wanted to do and how we would even go about doing it. So this made communication very difficult. This lack of focus made many members feel lost and no one really had a clear idea of how we would make our game. However as our ideas formed and the project came to take shape, our communication ramped up along with it. The high point was this past week. We made a discord server at the beginning of the project and in the final week of development it was constantly buzzing with questions, answers, and ideas on what we could do. The deadline forced us to communicate more but a clearer vision also helped all of us in communication. 

TODO Major Surprises: 

The main thing we would do differently next time is having mini deadlines throughout the development process. We needed some last-minute heroics from Michael to get all of our code fully integrated into our final working game and that was entirely avoidable. It’s nice to have a final product but the crunch time push from all of us was tiring and stressful. Multiple smaller deadlines would have pushed all of us to be more efficient with our time and avoid the last-minute finish we had. We could have also communicated better in the beginning of the project. The very beginning of the project was a very crucial time for us to get a clear vision of how we would make our game. Instead of spending a few periods talking as a team and having defined ideas, we didn’t communicate much and that set us back.
